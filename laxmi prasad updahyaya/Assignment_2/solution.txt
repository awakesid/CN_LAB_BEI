1):
The differences between OSI & TCP/IP model are :

a.
OSI is the generic, protocal independent standard, acting as the
communication gateway between the network and end user.
TCP/IP model is based on standard protocals around which the Internet
is developed. It is a communication protocal, which allows connection
of hosts over a network 

b.
In OSI model the transport layer gurantees the delivery of packets.
In TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantees delivery of
packets. Still the TCP/IP model is more reliable.

c.
OSI model follows vertical approach while 
TCP/IP model follows horizontal approach.

d.
OSI model has a saparate Presentation layer and Session layer,while 
TCP/IP model does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session
layer.

e.
OSI is a reference model around which the networks are built. 
Generally it is used as a guidance tool.
TCP/IP model is, in a way implementaiton of the OSI model.

f. 
OSI model has 7 different layers , while 
TCP/Ip model has 5 different layers.

g.
OSI model was developed before the development of the protocols.
In TCP/Ip model , protocols were developed first and then only model was 
developed.

h. 
OSI model supports connectionless and conncection-oriented communication
in the network layer.
TCP/IP model supports only connectionless communication in the network 
layer.






2) 
The differences between  Client-Server network architecture & Peer-to-Peer 
network architecture are: 
a.(Basic)
In a client-server network , we have a specific server and specific clients
connected to the server.
In a peer-to-peer network , client are not distinguished; every node act as
as a client and server.

b.(Expense)
A client-server network is more expensive to implement.
A peer-to-peer network is less expensive to implement.

c.(Stability)
A client-server network is more stable and scalable than a peer-to-peer network.
A peer-to-peer network is less stable and scalable,if the number of peers
increases the system.

d.(Data)
In a client-server network , the data is stored ina centralized server.
In a peer-to-peer network, each peer has its own data.

e.(Server)
A server may get overloaded when many customers make simulteneous service
requests in a client-server network .
A Server is not bottlenecked since the services are distributed among 
numerous servers usinga a peer-to-peer network.

f.(Focus)
Client-server network architecture focuses on sharing the information.
Peer-to-peer network focuses on connectivity.

g.(service)
In client-server network , the server provides the requested service in 
response to the client's request.
In peer-to-peer network, each node has the ability to both request and delivery
services.

h.(Performance)
In client-server , the server does the bulk of the work, performance is 
unaffected by the growth of clients.
Because resources are shared in a big peer-to-peer network,performance will 
likely to suffer.

i. (Security)
A Client-Server network is a secured network because the server can verify a
client's access to any area of the network, making it secure.
The network's security deteriorates, and its susceptibility grows as the 
number of peers rises.



3)
The seven layers of OSI model are : 

a. Physical Layer: Its purpose is establishing, maintain, and terminate 
communication between two endpoints on different networks. It does this
by defining the connection type (wired or wireless), medium of 
transmission (fibre optic cable, copper wire, etc.), signal types 
(analogue or digital) and electric voltages used in data transmission. 
The physical layer also handles issues related to synchronization and 
addressing at the media level. In addition, it defines how devices interact 
with each other at a hardware level so that data can be sent between them successfully.

b. Data link Layer:
The Data Link Layer provides reliable data transmission over a physical communication
link. It handles the physical addressing of each node and ensures that data is 
properly transferred between two connected nodes on a network. This OSI layer also
defines how the network will handle data errors, retransmitting lost packets, and
flow control mechanisms such as windowing.

c. Network layer:
This OSI Layer is mainly responsible for routing data packets from one node to another
on a network. It establishes logical paths between endpoints (nodes) on a network and
determines the best route for each packet to take to reach its destination. This OSI
layer also handles addressing, subnetting, packet fragmentation and reassembly, and
traffic congestion control mechanisms if needed.

d. Transprt layer:
The Transport Layer is primarily responsible for providing reliable end-to-end delivery
of data packets across a network. It segments large data units into smaller ones 
(called frames) so that they can be transferred more efficiently between nodes on 
a network. This layer in OSI also handles the retransmission of lost or damaged 
packets and flow control mechanisms such as sliding windows.

e. Session layer:
The Session Layer in OSI is majorly responsible for creating, maintaining, and managing
the communication between two endpoints (nodes) on a network. It establishes logical 
(virtual) connections between host systems, coordinates data exchange between nodes, 
handles token-passing mechanisms to control access to shared resources on a network, 
and provides security measures such as encryption for data integrity.

f. Presentation layer:
The Presentation Layer in OSI is for converting data from one format to some other so 
that it can be understood by both endpoints (nodes) on a network. It translates 
application data sent across a network into an agreed-upon format and compresses it 
if needed to reduce overall transmission time. This layer in OSI also provides 
security measures such as encryption to ensure data integrity.

g. Application layer:
The Application Layer provides services to end-users, such as file transfer, 
web browsing, email, and chat. This OSI layer can also provide access to 
network resources, such as databases and printers.




4) The principles behind the OSI model are :
Layered Approach: 
The OSI model divides the complex task of network communication into seven distinct 
layers, making it easier to manage, design, and troubleshoot networks.

Independence of Layers: 
Each layer should perform its functions independently of the other layers, interacting
only with the immediately adjacent layers. This modularity allows for flexibility and 
ease of updates and changes.

Standardization: 
The OSI model provides a standardized approach for different network hardware and 
software to communicate, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between 
different systems and vendors.

Abstraction: 
The model abstracts the network functions into layers, allowing developers to focus 
on specific aspects of network communication without needing to understand the 
entire stack.

Encapsulation and Decapsulation: 
Data transmitted over a network is encapsulated with protocol-specific headers and 
trailers as it moves down the layers and decapsulated as it moves up. This process 
ensures that each layer handles only the relevant information.

Peer-to-Peer Communication: 
At each layer, communication occurs between corresponding layers (peers) on different 
devices. For example, the transport layer on one device communicates with the 
transport layer on another device using transport layer protocols.

Flexibility and Scalability: 
The model supports a wide range of protocols and technologies, allowing for the 
evolution and scalability of network systems.
