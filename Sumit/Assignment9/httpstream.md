- **Sec-Fetch-Site**: Indicates the relationship between the origin of the request and the requested resource. `none` means that the request is not related to any specific origin.

- **Sec-Fetch-User**: Indicates whether the request was initiated by a user action. `?1` means "yes" (the request was user-initiated).

- **Sec-Fetch-Dest**: Specifies the type of content being requested. `document` means the request is for a document, such as an HTML page.
